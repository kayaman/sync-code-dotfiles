# Coding Standards

## General Principles

1. **Readability First**: Code is read far more often than it is written. Optimize for readability.

2. **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class should do one thing well.

3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns into reusable functions.

4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add functionality until it's needed.

## Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly, don't ignore them
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Fail fast and loudly in development
- Fail gracefully in production

## Documentation

- Document the "why", not the "what"
- Keep documentation close to the code
- Update docs when code changes

## Testing

- Write tests for critical paths first
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests focused and independent
